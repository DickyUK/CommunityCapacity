## 7. Please tell us a bit about the specific SA initiative and background: 

### What are the aims and objectives of the SA initiative? 

#### Our initiative is called Resilient Communities. 
Through building community capacity and resilience, the project aims to provide early intervention and prevention to support people and communities to live independently and to have active, prosperous and healthy lives. 
As part of Resilient Communities and a new a borough wide initiative; we have developed a social prescribing service.  Through a partnership between the voluntary and community sector groups and the council; 'Making Connections Walsall' has been developed by Walsall Council's Public Health team in partnership with the VCS.  

#### The objectives are:

* to improve the health and wellbeing of residents by tackling loneliness.  
* to commission and work proactively and in partnership with the voluntary sector to utilise social networks and community groups to improve the health and wellbeing of the community 
* to target interventions that build social relationships amongst isolated groups  
* to utilise existing expertise and knowledge in voluntary sector organisations by taking referrals from health and social care professionals

### Is this a newly emerging initiative or has it been in development for some time? 

This project is an existing strand of the Walsall Together Programme with an established network of partners and collaborators.  

The programme has been running for several years and recently reviewed by KPMG with a view to making further improvements and continued funding and investment in the partnership. The councils Public Health team has already launched a successful social prescribing project as part of this initiative and is 'pump priming' community initiatives such as befriending services, which engages the community in volunteering activities. This scheme, called 'Making Connections', has now been running now for approximately 18 months.

### What role does co-production play in the shaping, design and delivery of the initiative? 

Our aspiration is to develop a broader vision and a range of activities through co-producing the design and delivery of what the communities both wants and needs.  It is evidence-led, taking cues from work and research carried out by the Social Care Institute for Excellence, as well as the Joseph Roundtree Foundation and Peter Beresford, Shaping Our Lives.  We have a vision which is reflective of the interest and desire to work more closely with our communities and together across various internal directorates (spanning Economy and Environment, Public health, Children’s and Adult services), in collaboration with our colleagues in the police, fire service and through Walsall Together. Additionally, we are working closely with our other statutory partners including the NHS CCG and housing.

We have plans and activities in motion to more widely engage citizens in our communities; including both democratically and politically in decisions and service design.  Co-production is critical to the shaping of our current vision, to ensure we evolve it to reflect a broader and more diverse community.  Ensuring that services are designed inclusively and reflect the communities needs and wants, and make the delivery more efficient and effective, by working to a greater degree with strengths and assets within our communities.

## 8. Who are some of the primary/potential partners involved in the project? 

### Who are the key actors within the initiative? 
The Social Action initiative is part of a programme bringing together the following parties:
* NHS Walsall Clinical Commissioning Group made up of GP practices across Walsall; 
* Walsall Healthcare Trust: Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership Trust
* Walsall Council 
* Walsall residents 
* One Walsall (the VCS body in Walsall and key representatives from the voluntary sector)
#### *Key actors include:* ####
* Integrated Commissioning Commissioners for Children’s, Adults and Economy and Environment (with a focus on green spaces, activities, leisure, employment and regeneration)
* The CEO and lead for the Voluntary and Community Services Sector partner
* CCG and Public Health commissioner colleagues (already engaged in social prescribing)
~~To be developed further~~

### What roles and responsibilities do they undertake? 

~~To be developed~~

### Which groups do you anticipate having a direct relationship with the research team?

At relevant stages of the initiative, we are expecting that all the parties above would be engaged in some form in the research.  The relationship however with the research team will be coordinated by the local authority lead.  

## 9. How does the SA initiative link to the council’s strategy for commissioning? 

### How does this fit into the broader context of commissioning within the Local Authority? 

The council’s Adult Services commissioning intentions underpin the current council corporate plan 2018-2021, and agreed in the Corporate Management Team, linking directorate priorities and corporate priorities.  Our directorate  [commissioning intentions are explained here in more detail](https://go.walsall.gov.uk/Portals/0/Uploads/SocialCare/Adult%20Social%20Care%20Directorate%20Plan%202017-%202018.pdf). Specifically, our vision within Adult Social Care is: 

*"We work with citizens and communities to promote health, wellbeing and independence and if people need additional support we work with partners to ensure that people can access high quality services which maximise independence and safety, and that respect the autonomy, dignity and diversity of the citizens of Walsall."*

Our social action initiative fits with the broader commissioning within the council because we are moving from traditional single commissions and silo working, to commissioning more strategically and across directorates.

Our social action initiative fits with the broader commissioning within the council because we are moving from traditional single commissions and silo working, to commissioning more strategically and across all directorates.  The social action indeed requires that we work in this way because it is impossible to deliver against the social action, providing the community with what it requires, unless we work closely with the community to take ownership and the lead.  It means that as a statutory authority we a letting go more, handing control over or sharing more through being increasingly open.  Resilient Communities is therefore a crucial element of the councils overall transformation programme, and is explicit within the plans.  Under section 1 of our commissioning intentions document (see the link above) two out of the five priorities are about greater partnership working.  Within the directorate plan, developing Sustainable Communities and the Social Care Market is one of our three key strategic priorities for the planning period 2017-2020. 

### Is there the likelihood of continued funding or other support for the project beyond the next 12 months?

The project duration is expected to be 2-3 years, with a number of stages. It is a permanent part of the Walsall Together programme and strategy as outlined above.  This forum is also where the local strategy and plans for integrated commissioning are ddeveloped, in addition to the Sustainability Transformation Plans and use of the Better Care Funds. We are also currently preparing a bid to our own Transformation funds.

## 10. What are the aims of the project from January 2019 - January 2020 and the anticipated impacts? 

~~To be developed~~ 

### Give a brief outline of the project plan during this period and how working with the ESA team project will add value to this. 

~~To be developed~~

The research team will only be directly involved for 12 months from January 2019 and are unable to consider projects that will launch after January 2019.

## 11. Why would this be a good project for the ESA programme to work with? 

### Explain why your initiative would have useful learning for the broader national picture of SA development? 

Whilst there are pockets of exceptional good practice outside the council as well as some colleagues inside the council, Walsall over the years for various reasons has suffered from a lack of investment, coordination and focus in to the voluntary and community sector.  There is consequently more to gain, with greater leaps forward with potentially evolutionary step change. We are proud of our past and present but also not wedded to old or traditional ways of working if they do not help communities.  Walsall aspires to and expect highly innovative approaches to develop, as well as truly embedding a different way of working – this is exemplified through our moto – Proud of our Past, Proud of our Present, and Proud for our Future.  

The social action initiative is part of the broader council transformation programme and a new corporate council wide Transformation programme, providing opportunities to embed what we learn in to normal business as usual activities – so coproduction is mainstreamed. This means we access a broader team offering greater capacity and access to skills and means that our social action initiative links with other parts of the corporate Transformation Programme, including a corporate wide Customer Services programme, as well as transformation programmes within every directorate and part of the councils operations, including Economy and Environment, Public Health and Children services. 

### Is there something distinctive/innovative that you are trying to do that others could learn from? 

Walsall is beginning to adopt a unique approach to how we use technology.  We have recently re-launched corporate ICT programme that is responding to what the council and its customers and wider community need in order to be a modern responsive organisation. In this social action, we are using digital platforms to enhance the degree of involvement and engagement of the wider community. For example, we made use of GitHub (an open source digital platform normally used by developers, coders and software engineers) to develop our vision with the wider community and make it easier for people less able to attend events physically through using an open tool.  

Github is free and open source, and incorporates ideas of ‘crowd-sourcing’ but whereas the crowd sourcing exploits a ‘million people for a million good ideas’ open sourcing leverages million people to develop the best idea. Github for example was used by the Obama campaign for fund raising – so it is not only for software development!  It is important tool in the development of Netflix, Amazon, Sony PS4 and Apple; where the key to the success of these companies was the collaboration and coproduction on what they developed – with people not employed or paid!  So all the more disappointing that some of these companies play down or don’t promote this aspect of coproduction and take a great deal of the benefit for the shareholders only. Ultimately though, the technology and platforms are secondary to the attitude of how we embrace coproduction and it is this that we want to learn about how we fully and incorporate in to our normal business practice.

### Are you tackling a common challenge but in a distinctive fashion? 

Our Social Action - Building community capacity and resilience - is a common challenge; the [Socail Care Institute for Excellence](https://www.scie.org.uk/) has a unit that [leads on a member network building community capacity](https://www.scie.org.uk/news/opinions/building-community-capacity) which the council and the lead for this initiative are members.  It is part of the councils corporate vision that to deliver against this mandate we need to work in a highly effective and collaborative way with the market (one of our three commissioning intention objectives in our 2017-2020 plan) which includes fully embracing the voluntary and community sector (VCS). 

What is particularly distinctive however in our approach that has been an emergent strategy is our style of working collaboratively across our internal directorate partners within the council.  This sounds simple and like common sense - and it is - but it is rarely done.  Being one council is critical in order to work more effectively with the VCS, as evidenced in the partners above in this bid.  We recognise that if we commission collaboratively, we can be more supportive and work more effectively with the VCS in a collaborative fashion, more effectively identifying gaps and duplication in provision.  This is then also underpinned by the innovative use of open source digital platforms explained above – which makes the collaboratively partnership working more scalable and sustainable.

## 12.  What benefits do you hope your project will gain from working with the research team? 

**We need to develop this:**
- Learning
- Network
- External visiobility impetus to drive internal resources and focus
- Good practice elsewhere
- An evidence base to support the ongoing development of our business case and focussing of investment in things that work

### You need to be clear both about what type of learning you are seeking in order to drive your initiative forward or to demonstrate its impact and why working with the research team might be the best way to achieve this?
